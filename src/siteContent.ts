Can we base our predictions of the future price of an asset on our perception of what information others have?',

In summary, the method groups time-series data (exchanges of securities) into buckets, and assumes that if a security is traded in high volume or frequently over a short span of time, traders of the security likely have more information than you.'

Everything worked, but there was an out standing problem - we were on a budget and working with a lot of data. Our budget ruled out brute forcing things and paying for large servers. I had proposed a solution using Python, Pandas, Numpy, and Scipy to make things more manageable.',
        'While SAS was objectively a better-optomized tool for running data analysis, it lacks the fundamental intuitivity that Python has. Operations like slicing data and expanding records, were convoluted in SAS but are crucial to the VPIN algorithm. SAS was difficult to use, and resulted in more "test-flights" while prototyping the code. Each run of the SAS script would take days to run!'

I had to find a way to automate the conversion of this data into a useable format. A requirement was that the data be split into databases on a "per-firm" basis - one database for AAPL and another of MSFT.',
        'SQLite3 ended up being the right tool for this job considering the scope of the project and time (and space) constraints. In other life, I would have chosen a well-optomized single database with fast access to data on a "per-firm" basis.'
